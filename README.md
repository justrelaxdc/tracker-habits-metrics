## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Create your first tracker in under a minute.**

### 1. Create a tracker
1. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on Mac).  
2. Run **“Create new tracker”**.  
3. Enter a name (e.g., “Morning Workout”).  
4. Choose (or auto create) a folder.  
5. Select the tracker type.

7. Click **Create**.

<!-- 🎥 GIF: Creation flow — open palette → create new tracker → choose type → file appears -->

> You can structure trackers inside folders (up to 3 levels). The plugin will automatically interpret these folders as categories/subcategories. Folders containing the word `archive` are ignored, so old trackers can be saved there.

## 📁 Tracker File Structure

You normally don’t need to edit trackers manually — they are managed automatically.  
Advanced users can use Dataview to extract data from trackers:

```markdown
---
type: good-habit          # good-habit, bad-habit, number, plusminus, text, scale
trackingStartDate: "2025-01-01"

minValue: 0               # scale only
maxValue: 10              # scale only
step: 1                   # scale and plusminus

minLimit: 5               # optional, can be your target
maxLimit: 100             # optional, a limit you don't want to cross

unit: "kg"                # optional, will appear next to the title and in the chart

data:{"2025-01-01":1,"2025-01-02":1,"2025-01-03":0}
  
---
```

### Value types by tracker type
- **good-habit / bad-habit:** `1` or `0`  
- **number:** numeric value  
- **plusminus:** numeric counter with step  
- **text:** string  
- **scale:** numeric value within `[minValue … maxValue]`

## 📊 Statistics Explained

This section breaks down every statistic displayed in the tracker.

### For Habits (Good Habit / Bad Habit)

**PERIOD section:**
- **Completion rate** (or "Days without" for bad habits) – percentage of successful days in the selected period with visual progress bar  
  - Shows completion percentage and ratio of active days to total days (e.g., "75% (15/20)")

**STREAKS section:**
- **Current streak** 🔥 – consecutive successful days from the selected date backwards  
- **Best streak** ⭐ – longest consecutive successful period ever recorded

### For Metrics (Number / Scale / Counter / Text)

**PERIOD section:**
- **Active days** 📅 – number of days with recorded values vs total days in period (e.g., "18/30")  
- **Sum** 📈 – total sum of all values in the selected period  
- **Average** 📊 – average value across the period  
- **Min | Max** 📉 – minimum and maximum values in the period  
- **Median** 📊 – median value of all entries in the period

> **Note:** For text trackers, values are counted as word count. Statistics are calculated for the period specified by the `days` parameter (default: 30 days).
